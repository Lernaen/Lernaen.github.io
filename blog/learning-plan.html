    <h1> My Learning Plan for Bootcamp </h1>
    <p>
      <ol class="ol2">
      <li> My long term goals involve either doing self-employed consulting on web design, or working for a company that creates a product or service I enjoy, My end goal is to own a piece of property in a rural area where I can keep some goats and donkeys. I also want to be able to work in an environment where being fat and trans doesn't get me constantly judged poorly, aand that won't wreck my body through extensive hours working outside in the elements, and overworking it with constant 70+ hour weeks. It affects my mental health to work primary industries being trans.</li>
      <li> My strengths when it comes to learning is a quick uptake of technical terms, a fascination with novel concepts and the belief that close to every situation has lessons to be associated with it, and a relatively easy manner of personal interaction with others based on an ethos of egalitarianism.
      My weaknesses are a tendency to over-focus on details, time-blindness, ptsd-related brain fogging, and a tendency to overreact when I don't immediately show competency in a subject (admittedly I have spent a decade working on this one). I feel much more comfortable learning remotely, though I intend to spend at least 2 days a week on campus in order to strengthen in-person relations with my fellows. I can do people a bit better in person, but I also get uncomfortable if I can't escape to an alone space periodically.</li>
      <li> I'd love to be able to promote myself better, and learn self-advocacy while I'm pitching ideas I believe have merit. I would like to be able to use my autism to my advantage rather than my detriment. I'll never finish learning, but skills interacting with the corporate and tech worlds would be welcome, as currently I mostly just brute force my attempts and it leads to friction between me and Leadership structures.</li>
      <li> I will be available via the discord anytime I'm not asleep or choring, and with my group learners i'll be willing to share my email and cellphone number in case of urgent need. My plans for in-campus learning is currently to attend in person two days a week, likely Wednesday and Thursday, and have cleared my schedule of non-necessary hobby expense and time to help with focus (I still have hobby and socialising time, I just deprioritised some of it). I'm fine wearing a mask for an hour or so in a row, and so will plan to take breaks outside when on campus. My current work commitments are casual-basis only, and adds up to roughly 10 hours a month. 
      When I feel stress building up (and I'm pretty good at recognizing that now), I will start by pulling back fo rfive minutes before re-engaging, if the stress continues I will seek out food or a cup of tea, and if I'm really riled up, i will retreat to a quiet corner for a short while relative to how stressed I feel. If there's any serious issues, I will liase with a facilitator.</li>
      <li> If I'm unable to resolve a technical problem or personal conflict, I will speak to someone else within an hour or so, a Facilitator within a day if problems continue. Usually for technical problems I will try 4-5 iterations before asking for help, and will continue iterating while waiting for assistance.</li>
      <li> I expect Facilitators to assist on technical issues, and potentially resolve interpersonal issues that cannot be resolved by communication with my peers. To be non-judgemental as much as possible and available during campus hours. I'd maybe like to hang out with some of them, but only if they're happy to.</li>
      <li>Sunday Evenings 1600-2100 is blocked out for Family Dinner, Ideally I'd like to learn remotely on Mondays and Tuesdays as Wednesday is the beginning of my pay week, and I feel much more comfortable being away from my house when I have monetary resources, as food I don't have to prepare and plentiful variety of drinks helps me regulate my emotions. A few of the weeks I will be spending Saturdays through tuesdays in Kapiti and learning remotely from there. ONe Sqaturday a month I will be playing dungeons and Dragons, and apart from that i'm free barring sickness or emergencies.</li>
