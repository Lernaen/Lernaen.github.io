    <h1>Javascript Explorations</h1>
    <p>
      JS is a way to manipulate and link aspects of HTML and CSS. it gives many
      shortcuts to coding html, and lots of extra tools for creating and
      executing code snippets. it's like a terminal interface, letting you
      change the way you interact with code.

      control flow is the order of business, it travels in order of how you
      write it. E.g. you have to get dressed BEFORE you leave the apartment.
      Loops are a tool to let you run a piece of code mutiple times(within a
      limit, to avoid crashing). This is like practising an musical piece until
      you reach satisfaction with it's quality.

      The DOM is the interface you open on a live page, that lets you test how
      code lterations work before you commit them to code, and gives you some
      more intuitive tools than just your imagination to view how code works,
      and displays errors in a demonstrative manner.

      arrays are more like a data matrix, they just have values arranged in
      order, whereas objects have values linked to keys within the object.
      Arrays are indexed, starting at zero, but objects, linked to keys, can
      start at any value.
    </p>

      Functions are the basic instructions you will likely want to reuse across
      the document. If you want the same thing to happen across multiple
      instances, use a function. It's like setting up a hotkey that you use
      repeatedly in a game or other program.
