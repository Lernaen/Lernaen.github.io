    <h2>My strengths and challenges</h2>
    <p>
      My results from the 16 pt swiss test indicate the following tendencies: -
      **Perceiving**: You tend to be flexible, spontaneous, and open to new
      experiences rather than preferring structure and planning. -
      **Introversion**: You lean towards being reserved, introspective, and
      prefer solitary activities or small, close-knit groups over large social
      gatherings. - **Feeling**: You are more likely to make decisions based on
      personal values and emotions, considering how actions will affect others.
      - **Intuition**: You slightly lean towards focusing on future
      possibilities and abstract concepts rather than concrete facts and present
      realities. the High5 test indicated that I am a Philomath, Thinker,
      Brainstormer, Problem-Solver, and Strategist, which I feel aligns fairly
      well with how I approach challenges. Another test indicated that my
      primary strength is Kindness, which I agree with but feel thaat it's
      certainly not a value that is celebrated, but rather exploited An Ikigai
      test suggested the same thing, and suggested Robotics engineering as a
      good career path, which I found interesting, as that was the path I was
      interested in out of the engineering specialties I explored at university.
      I feel thatt my kindness and wish for less friction has often been taken
      advantage of during my career thus far, particularly by those higher on
      the ladder than me, and this has awoken a cynicism that leads to me
      putting in minimal effort. while I belive this is a rational response, it
      also does not help in situations managed by my own motivation. During my
      work at the dock, I saw many points of weakness in their operating
      procedures when I first started, and due to my novice status, was unable
      to effect any changes, and by the time I was taken seriously, the burnout
      had rendered me unable to remember the changes. If I were to do it over, I
      would note down the htings I saw until I had a more experienced view, then
      re-edit and present them again. some things really needed to be addressed.
      My nature precludes me from extolling the times I've made ehtical
      decisions, butI 'm sure in time I'll be able to explain something
