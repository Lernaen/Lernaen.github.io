          Superflipflop<br />
          For this problem, I used all the things i had. Rubberducky, googling,
          console logging, talking with classmates and facilitators, taking
          breaks and reading the test results, reflecting. In the end, long
          talks with the Facilitator (Thanks Gerard) I was able to noodle
          through a working solution.

          Honestly I'm not sure I actually elegantly solved a problem in this
          sprint, so I'll speak more generally. I've been using as many PS
          techniques as i can, but my quickest go-tos are using google for
          investigating, using test driven development and asking others for
          assistance, and often just for task doubling. When the solutions came
          easier, I was less frustrated, but I used it as an opportunity to
          apply more techniques than necessary, and learning where I could make
          improvements. Even if I don't run into problems, I can still learn
          from the work I do.

              <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
              -
              <p>
                I'm fairly confident, still need to refine what I write for it
                though.
              </p>

              <p>
                For this I'm very confident, I often take a screenshot so I can
                revert if it doesn't work.

              <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
              -
              <p>
                I have my own rubber ducky, and have been using it frequently.

              <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
              -
              <p>
                I'm comfortable, I can read them and find where it's
                referencing, and use it to fix errors.
              </p>
            </li>

              <h3>Console.logging</h3>
              -
              <p>
                It took me a while to get used to this, but now I'm happy to use
                it
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Googling</h3>
              -
              <p>
                I'm comfortable, but it often proves to be of limited help. I
                use it in my toolkit, but only to give me inspiration, rather
                than provide solutions.

              <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
              -
              <p>Happy to ask and give what help I can</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
              -
              <p>
                Sometimes I'm embarrassed to, but I make sure to do so promptly.

              <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
              -
              <p>
                My go to, it's what I'm most practiced at, and often gives me
                assistance.
              </p>

          Right after I needed help with the flipflop function and superflipflop
          immediately became a problem, I tried to power through without help
          for an hour or two. I should have asked for help earlier, instead of
          waiting.
