    <h4>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h4>

    <p>
      I project far more confidence than I realise or feel, I have a tendency to
      get distracted easily, and my ego is often suppressed to help the feelings
      of others.
    </p>

    <h4>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h4>

    <p>
      being able to know when you need to set boundaries, when you need to
      engage with your colleagues, and knowing your limits. Trying to keep it
      short and sweet, but their roles are basically integral to learning.
    </p>

    <h4>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h4>

    <p>
      quite how much of the curriculum I've spent the last 5 years teaching
      myself, thoug usually it's done in a nonverbal fashion on my end
    </p>

    <h4>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h4>

    <p>
      Probably maintaining self-reflection exercises as a daily thing, and
      putting down the things I find positive in myself down in text form for
      others' to read.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h4>

    <p>
      Because it's frankly the most important thing to learn about functioning
      in a workplace, far more than technical ability (I won't apply this
      universally, but I can learn pretty much any journeyman level technical
      skill, but functioning among other humans is really difficult for me)
    </p>

    <h4>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
      instead? Justify your answer.
    </h4>

    <p>
      No, the Human skills are essentially a vocational training session for
      functioning in a workplace setting, and I'm picking up the programming
      skills, but also getting used to working in a collaborative setting is
      necessary, particularly getting used to submitting imperfect work, and
      talking my work over with colleagues.
