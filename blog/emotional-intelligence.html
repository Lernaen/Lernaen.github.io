    <h1>Emotional Intelligence versus 'IQ'</h1>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is the aspect of human thought that encompasses
      emotions and empathy. How we relate to others, understand our own
      thoughts, the thoughts of others, and thinking in general. Personally, I
      feel that sapience is more complex than our current models of
      understanding, but a good start is separating different modes of thinking.
      traditionally, IQ was a metric used to gauge potential success through
      reasoning skills and logical processing, but it has become clear that
      these aspects of thought are not a proper reflection of success (a
      personal exammple of this is me, who has found that extreme limits of IQ
      are mostly alienating rather than leading to success.) I personally have a
      recorded IQ ranging between 132 and 154, and in my life, I found that it
      was limiting rather than advantageous. On the other hand, those being able
      to break through their intellectual limits by hard work, and those who
      relate to others more naturally, have found success far easier than I.
      <br />
      I like the model I found while researching this that breaks sapience into
      many strings of intelligence. taking the tests multiple times, I found my
      intelligence spheres lie primarily in Linguistic Reasoning and Musical
      reasoning. this largely fits with my current understanding of myself, at
      least as far as my personal explorations have uncovered.
      <br />
      Emotional intelligence is what is commonly known as Empathy and Sympathy,
      or one's capacity for such. When you understand the pain someone is going
      through without having to experience it yourself, that is Emotional
      intelligence.
