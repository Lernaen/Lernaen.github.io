    <div><h2>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h2>
      <p>I need to get out at least once a day for a walk, either around the block or a dog walk when in Paraparaumu. Maybe I will engage the local pools if I can get money for it, I do like swimming.
        Make sure to only have 2 energy drinks max a day, take my meds, make sure I'm eating enough. Sit at my desk instead of on the bed for at least 1 hour each day.
