      Essentially, you use the id tag if you want to change a single
      'element'(line of code) if you think you want to use the same style on
      different pieces of code, it's better to use a class tag. say, for
      example, you want to format a heaader banner, you can give the Id tag to
      the image element, because you will only have one header banner, and so
      will not be using the Id tag attributes again. whereas for paragraphs, you
      often need to use the same formatting rules again multiple times, leading
      to using the class tag. thoug if you just want to use it to change a
      single paragraph, you can add an ID tag to a single one of those
      paragraphs.
