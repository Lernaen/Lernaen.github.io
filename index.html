    <h2>My strengths and challenges</h2>
    <p> My results 
                  from the 16 pt swiss test indicate the following tendencies:

      - **Perceiving**: You tend to be flexible, spontaneous, and open to new experiences rather than preferring structure and planning.
      - **Introversion**: You lean towards being reserved, introspective, and prefer solitary activities or small, close-knit groups over large social gatherings.
      - **Feeling**: You are more likely to make decisions based on personal values and emotions, considering how actions will affect others.
      - **Intuition**: You slightly lean towards focusing on future possibilities and abstract concepts rather than concrete facts and present realities.</p>
      <p> the High5 test indicated that I am a Philomath, Thinker, Brainstormer, Problem-Solver, and Strategist, which I feel aligns fairly well with how I approach challenges.</p>
 <p> Another test indicated that my primary strength is Kindness, which I agree with but 
  feel thaat it's certainly not a value that is celebrated, but rather exploited </p>
  <p> An Ikigai test suggested the same thing, and suggested Robotics engineering as a good career path, which I found interesting, as that was the path I was interested in out of the engineering specialties I explored at university.</p>
  I feel thatt my kindness and wish for less friction has often been taken advantage of during my career thus far, particularly by those higher on the ladder than me, and this has awoken a cynicism that leads to me putting in minimal effort.
 while I belive this is a rational response, it also does not help in situations managed by my own motivation. </p>


 <h3> My culture is primarily my found family, and My Mum and sister, we value kindness and fortitude, but won't take shit from others.</h3>
 <p> During my work at the dock, I saw many points of weakness in their operating procedures when I first started, and due to my novice status, was unable to effect any changes, and by the time I was taken seriously, the burnout had rendered me unable to remember the changes.
  If I were to do it over, I would note down the htings I saw until I had a more experienced view, then re-edit and present them again. some things really needed to be addressed.
 </p>
 <p>My nature precludes me from extolling the times I've made ehtical decisions, butI 'm sure in time I'll be able to explain something</p>
